        <h5>University de Paris</h6>
        <p>I studied Design in the 21:st Century at University de Paris. I had never been to Paris before and was so exited going there on my own. The program I went was in English but we where both French students and students from other countries around the world. I became close to my classmates really fast and we are still keeping a close contact to this day. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I had a 25 minute walk from my apartment to the school, and before I arrived in Paris I looked at google maps. I was a little bit nervous that I was going to have to take a bus or bike in order to get to class on time. During my final days in Paris I began taking long-cuts in order to make my walk to and from class as long as possible. I walked as slow as I could, appreciating every smell, every sight, all of the sounds, and just the feeling of walking through the most beautiful city I had ever experienced. I advise everyone to take the ‘long-cuts’ home, and relish every second of them. Take in every second and don't take any of it for granted.

        <h5>London School for Advanced Studies</h5>
        <p>I studied Philosophy and Sustainability at London School for Advanced Studies about two years ago and I can really recommend. London has great universities and there are a lot of different programmes to choose between. I grew a lot as a person studying abroad and the whole experience was amazing. I am not the best at making new friends and I thought that was going to be a problem before going, but not at all. All of my classmates where sooo friendly and we all helped each other with everything. After classes we used to go to different bars around London, and on weekends we went out dancing. After this experience I have gotten new friends for life.

        <h5>University of Sydney</h5>
        <p>I had to learn how to adapt to new environments quickly. Because I have never been out of the country and have only taken 
          a plane one other time in my life, I really had to learn to adjust to the traveling and learning how to navigate through new 
          places. I had a couple of other friends from my school in the same program, but also easily made new friends within my 
          classes and program. This allowed me to open up and create new friendships as I was exploring the world for the first time. 
          I have never been more than three hours away from my family, so being in a different time zone and not being able to see them for 
          those couple of months was hard, but helped me become more independent.</p>

        <h5>Universidad de Madrid</h5>
        <p>I didn't know any Spanish when I arrived in Madrid and therefore I had to work a lot harder and ask more questions than 
          the other students who had taken Spanish in college or for many years. This helped me to push myself—I was able to get 
          around places on my own after one month of being in Madrid. Being immersed made me work harder and feel the need to use the 
          language, so I used it as much as I could and asked many questions.
          <br>
          <br>
          Now that I'm home, I feel that I can communicate more with the Spanish speaking students at my university because they’re 
          studying abroad and some of them struggle with English. If I can talk in some Spanish to them, it might help them to be more 
          comfortable and know that I am there to learn just like they are—and that I have done what they are doing.</p>
